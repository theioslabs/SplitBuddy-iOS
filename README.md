_A Community-Driven Open Source Expense Sharing App_

<!-- optional banner/logo -->

---

## 🚀 Overview  

SplitBuddy is an **open-source alternative to Splitwise**, built by the **iOS Labs community**.  
Our mission is to create a **meaningful, impactful, and production-grade product** that helps people easily manage shared expenses with friends, roommates, colleagues, or travel groups.  

Unlike typical “just another app” clones, SplitBuddy is designed to be:  
- **Educational** → Built with modern Apple-recommended frameworks, patterns, and tools.  
- **Practical** → A real solution to real-world daily problems.  
- **Collaborative** → A community project where anyone can contribute, learn, and grow.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

We are following best practices with a **pure Swift ecosystem**:  
- **SwiftUI** → Declarative UI  
- **TCA (The Composable Architecture)** → Scalable architecture & state management  
- **Combine & Swift Concurrency (async/await)** → Reactive & structured concurrency  
- **SwiftData / CoreData** → Local persistence  
- **RESTful APIs (planned)** → For sync and future cloud support  
- **Unit + Snapshot Tests** → Reliability & CI/CD ready
